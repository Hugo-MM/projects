# Projects

This repository contains projects I developped during my Data Scientist training at Jedha bootcamp (summer 2021).


## Unsupervised Machine Learning

'Uber_Pickups' is a clustering project aiming at automatically finding out where the dense areas are located in Manhattan in order to propose hourly recommendations to Uber drivers.

## Supervised Machine Learning

The project 'Conversion_Rates' is a classification problem on an unbalanced dataset (97% no, 3% yes). Various methods are implemented and compared (logisitic regression, decision tree & random forest, optimization of probability threshold, optimization of class weights, undersampling).

## Deep Learning

This Deep Learning project aims at performing binary classification in the context of text sentiment analysis. For this Natural Language Processing project, various neural networks models are implemented (simple embedding, RNN, LSTM) and their performances on this specific case study are compared.

## Movie Hunter (personal project)

Movie Hunter is a personal project I developped during the last two weeks of the training. The goal was to build a product from scratch : starting with raw data analysis up to the development of a web app implementing various Machine Learning techniques. The folder 'Movie_Hunter' contains the studies of different recommendation models (collaborative filtering with truncated SVD and item-based recommendations) as well as their implementation into a web app using Django framework.
